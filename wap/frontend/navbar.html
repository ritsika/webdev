          <p class="animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft" style="animation-delay:0.5s">In circumstances where primary concern of human being is earning enough money to afford a day's meal, health,
            hygiene and education can understandably take a back seat. We at Noble Cause Foundation understand this very 
            much and have decided to open shortly, its first formal school in a rural area. The aim of this project is to provide, 
            quality education and hygiene awareness to children who belong to the financially weaker section of the society.
            Special emphasis will be given tp girl child's education. <br>
            PROPOSED SCHOOOL FACILITIES AND PROCEDURES:<br>
          ->Classes run from Junior kindergarten to 7th in the formal school.<br>
          ->7 classrooms and one computer room and a library.<br>
          ->Vocational training facility

          <h5 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Health</h5>
          <p class="animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft" style="animation-delay:0.5s">Good health is a precursor to a good education and a financially independent life.
            but while a privileged few are willing and able to afford home check-ups and expensive treatments, most of the people living in semi 
            urban and rural areas are deprived of professional health care Services.
          
            <br>
            With this in mind, NCF is planning to launch the community health program, a multi-faceted project that focuses on establishing sustainable practices and spreading awareness regarding preventative health among rural masses.
            Unde this program, HCF addresses the health care needs of poor and underprivileged groups through various projects. <br>
            We are also planning to conduct psychological counselling to the poor in rural and semi-urban areas for women and children where 
            cousnelling will be provided for family planning, health checkups. Alongside we are also conducting a free medical camp in rural areas for the benefit of the underprivileged.

          <p class="animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft" style="animation-delay:0.5s">At Noble Cause Foundation we have chalked out a program to directly implement its development initiatives for 
            underprivileged communitites residing in remote villages as well as semi-urban and urbann slums
          in which community based organizations are identified, handheld and made sustainable for implementing their projects.Through this program, NCF intends to implement a variety of intervention projects. 
          Education will be provided to underprivileged children living in remote areas . under our mission about education. Well-equipped mobile hospital units with medical expertise. services and medicines to make healthcare affordable. accessible and accountable. are planned under our Mission about Health . 
          Besides this, we are planning to setup or facilitite Health Camps. Integrated Community Development and Infrastructure Development projects such as construction of water reservoirs. wells. tube wells. roads and pathways in rural areas. to ensure overall welfare. 
          Also we are planning to provide hostel accommodation to women and children upto the age of 12 years in rural areas.

          <h5 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Empowering Women and Children</h5>
          <p class="animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft" style="animation-delay:0.5s"> Noble Cause Foundation strongly believes that women should have equal socio-economic, cultural and political opportunities as men. Several studies and survey show that. When we help women and empower them, the whole society benefits. 
             But unfortunately, women in India are far from being empowered. To tackle this inequality, NCF strives to start comprehensive programs on Self Help Groups.
            We hope to bring a considerable change in the lives of people by:
            <br> • Providing market oriented vocational skill training to women. 
            <br> • Commitment to help mothers of children who are attending educational classes, and involve them in saving, thrift and credit, skill training and income generation activities. 
            <br> • Integration of adult literacy with skill training and income generation or making literacy a precondition for skill training and income generation activities. 
            <br> • Development of leadership within the communities and linking them with govt and non-govt facilities. </p>

        <p class="animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft" style="animation-delay:0.5s"> "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." 
          At NCF, enabling self-reliance is the belief that permeates everything we do.<br> Our aim is to impart education and training to women, children and youth so that they can live a self-reliant life of dignity and respect. <br>
          With this thought, we have conceived in mind several vocational training programs across all our projects. 
          These programs provide marketable skills to the beneficiaries that can help them get competitive jobs.Along witht his, these programs are beneficial for students as well. At the end of the training, a certificate of completion can also be provided and is an overall good learning experience.</p>
